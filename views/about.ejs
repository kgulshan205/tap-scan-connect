            <h2> About</h2>
            <p>In addition to the world's high rate of population growth, technologies are also developing at an
                enormous rate. By saving time, the technology seeks to lessen the workload for humans. In this instance,
                the number of cars in this generation has increased significantly in comparison to previous generations.
                There has been a steady rise in traffic in the nations as a result of the rise in these vehicles.
                Because of the traffic in the cities, we have to wait a long time. Illegal parking on roadways and in
                other places is the primary cause of some traffic. To overcome this disadvantage, we usually suggest a
                method to avoid traffic.
                To overcome this disadvantage, we usually suggest a method to avoid traffic. The purpose of this paper
                is to provide the driver with a clear indicator of their vehicle's parking state. This approach makes it
                possible to lessen traffic congestion brought on by improper car parking.</p>
